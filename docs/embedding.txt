## Embedding CSM in your programs ##

### Linking to CSM ###

When CSM is installed, a [pkgconfig] ``csm.pc`` file is installed as well.
This makes it easy to link to CSM. 

[pkgconfig]: http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/

For example, on my system, after installing CSM, I can run ``pkgconfig`` to
get the C preprocessors and linker flags.

This is what I get on my system (on yours, paths will be different, of course).

     $ pkg-config --cflags csm  
       -I/sw/include -I/Users/andrea/svn/cds/csm/deploy/include/cairo
       -I/Users/andrea/svn/cds/csm/deploy/include

     $ pkg-config --libs csm 
       -L/sw/lib -L/Users/andrea/svn/cds/csm/deploy/lib 
       -lcsm-static -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

If you use GNU Make, a basic Makefile for your program linking to CSM
would be something like:

	CSM_FLAGS=`pkg-config --libs --cflags csm`

	myprogram: myprogram.c
		gcc $(CSM_FLAGS) -o myprogram myprogram.c

You can download the sources for this example in the repository (directory `docs/example-linking-make`).

If you use [CMake] --- and you should! --- it is reccomended that 
you use something like the following in your ``CMakeLists.txt``.

	cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4)
	project(myproject)

	# Require we have pkgconfig installed
	find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
	# Tell pkgconfig to look for CSM
	pkg_check_modules(CSM REQUIRED csm)

	IF(${CSM_FOUND})
		MESSAGE("CSM_LIBRARY_DIRS: ${CSM_LIBRARY_DIRS}")
		MESSAGE("CSM_LIBRARIES: ${CSM_LIBRARIES}")
		MESSAGE("CSM_INCLUDE_DIRS: ${CSM_INCLUDE_DIRS}")

		INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CSM_INCLUDE_DIRS}) # important! 
		LINK_DIRECTORIES(${CSM_LIBRARY_DIRS})    # important! 
	ELSE(${CSM_FOUND})	
		MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "CSM not found. Check that the environment \
		variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH includes the path containing the file 'csm.pc'.")
	ENDIF(${CSM_FOUND})		

	add_executable(myprogram myprogram.c)

	target_link_libraries(myprogram ${CSM_LIBRARIES}) # important! 

You can download the sources for this example in the repository (directory `docs/example-linking-cmake`).
