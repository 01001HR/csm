### Downloading ###

Download with SVN, using the following:

	$ svn checkout --username ANTANI svn://net143-184.mclink.it/csm

where `ANTANI` is your surname (you should have received a password). 

This will checkout both the source code
and some files used for experiments, that might be slightly slow to download.
If you are only interested in  the source code, use:

	$ svn checkout --username ANTANI svn://net143-184.mclink.it/csm/csm


### Required software ###

This software has been tested on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows XP (using Cygwin).

The build system is based on `cmake`, which is available at
  <http://www.cmake.org/>.

The only compiler tested was GCC (3.3 or 4.x).

For `carmen2pdf`, you will need the Cairo graphics library, available at
  <http://cairographics.org>


### Compiling ###

If you are lucky, this should be it:

	$ cmake .
	$ make

If you want to install this library system-wide, you could use:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local .
	$ make 
	$ make install

as the first step.


For installing the Ruby wrapper, refer to the separate instructions.
If you want to use the Ruby wrapper, I suggest to install the source
code in a `deploy` sub-directory of `csm`:

	csm/
		docs/
		csm/
		rsm/
		deploy/     <---  here

To do this, use:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd`/deploy .
	$ make 
	$ make install

(you have to give a complete path to `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH`).


### Getting started ###

You might get started by doing this:

	$ sm2 < in.log > out.log

where `in.log` is a Carmen-format log file. You can find one
in the top-level `experiments` directory: it is called `laserazosSM3.log`.

If you installed the Cairo library, you can see the result with:

	$ carmen2pdf -use odometry -in out.log -out out-odometry.pdf
	$ carmen2pdf -use estimate -in out.log -out out-estimate.pdf
