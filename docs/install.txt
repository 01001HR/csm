## Required software ##

This software has been tested on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows XP (using Cygwin).

The build system is based on `cmake`, which is available at
  <http://www.cmake.org/>.

The only compiler tested was GCC (3.3 or 4.x).

For `carmen2pdf`, you will need the Cairo graphics library, available at
  <http://cairographics.org>

## Installation ##

If you are lucky, this should be it:

	$ cmake .
	$ make

If you want to install this library system-wide, you could use:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local .

as the first step.

For installing the ruby wrapper, refer to the separate instructions.
